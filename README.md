# Digital Marketing Dashboard

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, I have created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to analyze digital marketing metrics. The dataset includes information about website sessions, bounces, unique pageviews, and other related metrics. The goal of this project is to gain insights into user behavior, engagement, and the performance of various content across different regions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- **Date**: The date when the data was recorded.
- **Sessions**: The number of sessions on the website.
- **Bounces**: The number of single-page sessions (i.e., sessions in which the person left the site from the entrance page without interacting with the page).
- **Unique Pageviews**: The number of individual views of a specific page.
- **Country**: The country from which the user accessed the website.
- **Page Title**: The title of the webpage.

## Tools and Software

For this project, I used Tableau as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. Tableau provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Tableau Dashboard**: The complete data analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
2. **Visualizations**: A variety of charts, graphs, and maps to support key findings and insights.
3. **Final Report**: A comprehensive summary of the analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## Visualizations

1. **Latest Year Sessions**: A line chart showing the number of sessions over the latest year.
 
2. **Bounces**: A line chart showing the number of bounces over the latest year.
 
3. **Unique Pageviews**: A line chart showing the number of unique pageviews over the latest year.
  

4. **Top 5 Pageviews by Country**: A bar chart displaying the top 5 countries by the number of pageviews.
  

5. **Top 5 Pageviews by Title**: A bar chart displaying the top 5 page titles by the number of pageviews.
